Arch Enemy guitarist Michael Amott has parted ways with the ESP guitar company. The partnership lasted eight years and included the ESP/LTD line of successful “Ninja” Michael Amott signature series guitars. <br> <br>

Michael Amott has issued the following statement: <br>

“I wasn’t really planning on announcing this and making a big deal out of it – but there’s a flood of e-mails and messages coming my way, as well as speculations on various forums. So I would like to set the record straight.” <br><br>

“1. It is true that I have parted ways with ESP guitars.“ <br>

“2. I have not yet decided on a new guitar company to work with”. <br>

“I would like to express my deepest gratitude to everyone at ESP USA and ESP JAPAN as well as all the distributors around the world for all their hard work and support over the last eight years!” <br>

“There’s no hard feelings, only good memories. It was just time to move on”. <br>

“I am extremely excited about getting a ‘fresh start’ and what I can achieve with another, future company as far as developing new Michael Amott weaponry!” <br>
